WARNING: This github constitutes a frozen version of the eggp code used for Russeil et al. 2025 analysis. A more recent and updated eggp python wrapper is available ["here"] (https://github.com/folivetti/pyeggp). It is available through PyPi and can be installed via a simple ```pip install``` command.


This github is a python wrapper of the Symbolic Regression method based equality graph, eggp, proposed by the paper ["Improving Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression with Equality Graphs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17848). This implementation includes a multi-view approach of the data, as explained in the paper ["Multi-View Symbolic Regression"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04298). The goal of MvSR is to discover parametric equations able to describe an ensemble of datasets, rather than generating a single solution to a single dataset. This wrapper is focused around the MvSR aspect of eggp.


Start by cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/erusseil/mvsr.git
```

And install it:
```sh
cd mvsr
pip install .
```
You must also install eggp manually:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libnlopt0
mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
curl -L -o $HOME/.local/bin/eggp https://github.com/folivetti/srtree/releases/download/v2.0.1.2/eggp-2.0.1.2-Linux-ghc-9.10.1
chmod +x $HOME/.local/bin/eggp
```

You are ready to use eggp MvSR. 
You can test it by running the simple test provided, which recovers a polynomial function (f(X) = AXÂ² + BX + C) from a set of three views. Run:


```sh
python simple_test.py
```

If everything goes as expected, the parametric solution discovered by MvSR should be printed and plots of the data along with the best fits should appear. 
As shown inside the example, you simply need to provide the path to a folder containing all the views for a given problem. They should be csv files with a specific formating. The columns should have a header indicating their name. The first columns correspond to your explanatory variables (X0, X1, ...) while the last column corresponds to the response variable (Y). In the code snippet, ```MvSR.plot_all_fits()``` offers a fast way to have an overview of the model's ability to fit the views. However you can find all the outputs of the symbolic regression run inside `MvSR.raw_results`.
